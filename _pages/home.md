The “AI for Interactive Technology” research group conduct research in the following main theme.

**Design and develop AI-based tools that that individuals can interact frequently to let it perform tasks that humans struggle.**

Much of AI/ML products today tackle tasks that humans are
already good at, essentially diverging from the idea
of developing novel technology for things that were not
possible in the past. Such tendencies have massive drawbacks
in the job market and holds humanity from moving forward to
explore previously impossible tasks. To this end, our group
mainly focuses on using AI/ML methodologies to tackle problems
that us humans find difficult to do alone.
